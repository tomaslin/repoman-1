Dashboard of interesting GitHub repositories

This application already works, but its code is of low quality. Its current function is to show which GitHub repositories are recently active and which
are not.

Problems
--------

* The code is not well written.
    * It was written without care for principles of software craftsmanship, code quality, or maintainability.
* The front end doesn't look very good.
* The short list of Netflix repositories is currently hard-coded.

Your job is to pay down the application's technical debt and also enhance the functionality.

Enhancements
------------

Instead of hard-coding a few GitHub repos, change the application so that it dynamically shows all the public
repos that are in the https://github.com/Netflix organization.

Make any changes to the front-end that you feel would improve the user experience.

Code quality
------------

Modify the code base so that it meets your standards for good code quality. Pretend that you are not just visiting someone else's code, but that you will be taking ownership of this project in the future, and you want it to be written the way you recommend writing applications.

Before you begin
----------------

Before doing the work, please let us know two things:
* Expected level of effort
    * How much actual programmer time the project will take. Knowing this helps us understand how much burden an assignment like this is putting on our candidates.
* Expected total elapsed time
    * What date you expect to be done, considering that you're also busy with other things in your life. Knowing this helps us schedule a code review discussion.

Next, log into GitHub, fork this repo, push changes to the fork. Before your scheduled code review, open a pull request.
